1 - Start 3 containers from an image that does not automatically exit (such as nginx) in detached mode.

	docker run --name <container name> -d nginx

	out:

		CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES
		229f5c4a808d   nginx                              "/docker-entrypoint.…"   12 seconds ago   Up 11 seconds              80/tcp    c3
		e12561daa5d7   nginx                              "/docker-entrypoint.…"   16 seconds ago   Up 15 seconds              80/tcp    c2
		161c306cf03d   nginx                              "/docker-entrypoint.…"   34 seconds ago   Up 34 seconds              80/tcp    c1

2 - Stop two of the containers and leave one container running.

	docker stop c1
	docker stop c2

	out:

		CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
